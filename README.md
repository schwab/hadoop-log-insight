# Log Insight Map Reduce
This map reduce code is designed to be run on hadoop or on the command line via the .sh scripts.

# hadoop-log-insight
Python implementations of map reduce which run on hadoop to extract, transform and load a specific application's 
log data into tidy data.  Since the log this works on is proprietary, it will not be named yet.  This code however, 
can be used to learn from and serve as a model.
